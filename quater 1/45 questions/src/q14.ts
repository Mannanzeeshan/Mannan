// Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

let guestList:string[]=["Usman","Humail","Ashir"];
for(let i=0;i<guestList.length;i++){
    console.log(`Hi ${guestList[i]}, I invite you for a dinner at my home`);
}
