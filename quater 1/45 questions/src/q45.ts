// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a 
// car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer
//  and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments.
//  Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pair, 
//  such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make 
//  sure all the information was stored correctly.
